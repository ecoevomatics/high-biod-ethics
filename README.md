# High throughput biodiversity: data for the many or the few, the oppressed or the oppressor? 

Is high throughput sequencing enabled biodiversity science ethical? Does it enable diverse groups of people to generate and access data they would not otherwise be able to access? Or does it further concentrate the power of studying biodiversity in the hands of the few privledged groups who have already benefitted from the oppression of others?

How much does it cost to collect, process, and sequence eDNA or metagenomic samples? How much does it cost to analyze them based on depth and number of samples? What is the training barrior to achieving samples and analyses? How does training and cost interact? (Less training, more cost).

- a figure with depth per sample and number of samples
- contours marking when a server is needed, when $5k is needed, etc

How well represented are taxa across the globe in sequence repos?

- a map showing prop of spp with seq data by different clades
- rarefy occurrences with seq data, divide that by rarefaction of all occurrences
- use bivariate pallette to show estimate and error

Data sov is an important part of the solution as well as training as well as improved tools (more efficient algos, better reference databases)
